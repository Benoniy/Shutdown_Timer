# Shutdown Timer:  

This is a small project that I made for my own convenience, it's simply a timer that is capable  
of running windows commands upon completion. It gives the user the option to shutdown, reboot  
or log off after a user specified delay.   

### Prerequisites:  

* Windows 7 or higher
* Java  

### How to run the program:  

Simply run the .exe file located in the git repository.
